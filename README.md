# UnityStation13
A game that might be made, might not be made, probably wont be.



FACTS:
This is the git repo for UnityStation13, a remake of SS14 in Godot and with none of the features that are in SS14. 
It will mainly include features from Unitystation, such as having "Unity" in the name. 
This is a hypothetical game, as it doesnt exist yet. Because it is hypothetical, it is hypotheticaly the best game ever, and is therefore better than Unitystation.
Anyone who says "US13" or "Unitystation13" is referring to this repo. Anyone who says otherwise is a liar and should be blocked on all social media.  
Anyone who contradicts anything said in this README is wrong.  Anyone who says the previous statement is wrong is a horrible person.  Anyone who says the previous statement or this statement is false is entirely correct. The previous statment is false.
